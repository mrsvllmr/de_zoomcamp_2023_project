# Topic and thought memory

- [x] Terraform (to create the GCP resources)
    - [x] main.tf <br>
    - [x] variables.tf <br>
    - [x] README.md <br>
- [ ] Script to create GCP Service Account and to create/set the roles needed (shoutout to https://github.com/MikhailKuklin/data-pipeline-COVID19-monitoring/blob/main/scripts/create_service_account.sh)

*Tomorrow*
    *- Compare sh script solution in "alternatives" to the current solution and use the best one (especially regarding the missing step of downloading/adding the json service account key to GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS for authentication with Google Cloud SDK - seems to be easier with/included in the sh script solution*
    *- Check the order of the steps and check optimisation/simplification possibilities (regarding README / How to make it work)*
    ([from my point of view good solution for comparison](https://github.com/MikhailKuklin/data-pipeline-COVID19-monitoring/blob/main/prerequisites_readme.md)) <br> <br>

> Note to me: specify next time with regard to the steps already implemented
